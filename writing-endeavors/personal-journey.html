    <h1>Personal Journey</h1>
    <p>My personal journey is all over the place.</p>
    <p>It started in middle school. Since I was a little kid I have enjoyed reading more than anything else. It became my passtime. I would carry a book with me everywhere. Any social event or get together with family, I would likely have one on hand.
        I always found my English classes as simple and not enough imagination put into them. I would always try to skew my essays or assignments into something mystical attempting to create a new layer of freedom in my personal life.
    </p>
    <p>By the time I reached high school I had continued this trend of reading books. It wasn't as obvious, but I still made it a priority in life. Getting in at least a couple hours of reading a day. It helped relieve my stress and made me work harder.
        I made many friends from reading. Having the same hobby made for a conversational piece that we could all use. Favorite books were shared and the want for more diversity increase. We would plot out a book idea that was so crazy that it would have made an interesting story.
    </p>
    <p>It wasn't until I served a full-time church mission that my eyes opened. Access to social media and games were limited and I actually enjoyed it. It gave me a lot of time to think what I wanted to do with life. Countless hours were taken to create worlds and characters that
        made me want to read even more. I decided in my head that since I wasn't able to read the books such as Percy Jackson or Mistborn, I would make something myself. It became a challenge to see what I could come up with. I would draw inspiration from my favorite stories.
        It started with me making hooks for my book ideas. Action packed and intriguing mystery that would make any person want to read the stories that I made.
    </p>
    <p>The only problem with this path that I was on was that I could never write more than 1 chapter of a book. I couldn't get the motivation to continue no matter how hard I tried. It became a pain on my side only being able to create hooks and introductions
        by not actually stories from my imagination. It took me many months and years to finally reach the point that I wanted in comfortablility for writing to push for more. I pushed myself. I started slow with writing no more than half a page every week. I gradually become happy with writing a page a day or a couple of pages a day.
        Enough to make me happy and excited for the next session that I had. It gave me motivation to move as I went and did it. It was eye opening. It helped me in other aspects of life such as education, my career, and life. It gave me more than I could ever give back and I'm excited to continue.
